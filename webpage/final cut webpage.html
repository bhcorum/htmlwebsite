This is my first attempt at an HTML web page.
<h1>Welcome to my first web page!</h1>
<div style="max-width: 700px; word-wrap:break-word;">
    Ideally, I want this to look like a legitimate website as much as possible. Seeing that it is my first attempt, I assume its going to look like some kid's first website that has been pulled straight out of the early 90's. Without having any previous coding knowledge, making this page has and will continue to help me understand this sort of a thing to a higher degree. I have been scouring the internet in search of code words that will help my page look better, but so far this is the best I could do.

<h1>My List of Hobbies</h1>
<p>
<h2>First and foremost, I enjoy playing video games.</h2>
<div style="max-width: 700px; word-wrap:break-word;"> I've fallen in love with the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls_(series)"> Souls' games. </a>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls_III"> Dark Souls 3 </a> is the game that got me into this style of games. This game is a descendant of the infamous Dark Souls game. While this game is a little easier than Dark Souls, it shares in core gameplay elements in a sense that they both take place in what we would call, the Medieval Period. The game makes you constantly think about how you're going to approach every new area. With "one-shotting" enemies and map hazards, dying and restarting is a huge part of this game. In fact the original Dark Souls was remade with the title of "Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition".
    <div> <br> The cycle goes like this: </div>
<ol>
    <li>Fight a Boss</li>
    <li>Die to said Boss</li>
    <li>Grind souls on trash mob enemies</li>
    <li>Return to the Firelink Shrine</li>
    <li>Upgrade your skills</li>
    <li>Return to your last visited bonfire</li>
    <li>Progress to Boss area</li>
    <li>Beat the Boss and proceed</li>
    <li>Repeat</li>
</ol>

    <br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekiro:_Shadows_Die_Twice"> Sekiro  </a> is another game in this series that, unlike Dark Souls, is set in Japan and focuses more on clashing swords with your opponent no matter how big they are. This game is equally focused on mystical superpowers and like Dark Souls, you are on a mission to link your life-force with its origin. Between fighting katana wielding lackeys, or fighting mystical divine beasts, this game pulls even less punches than Dark Souls 3. Without being able to summon friends to assist you, you're truly alone in the world on a quest to follow the Iron Code and help your new-found master... or will you?

<h2>I also enjoy working on my PC</h2>
<p> <b>You can find my PC build <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/6B6KZf"> here.</a></b>
<div style="max-width: 700px; word-wrap:break-word;">
    I have been putting this PC together over the past 2 years, slowly accumulating parts for it. It seems that nothing has come easy with this PC. I just recently upgraded to 32GB of RAM for my system so I can play any game on top settings without a problem. With this upgrade I (hopefully) won't have to upgrade for at least a few years. <p>Among:</p> <div>
        <ul>
            <li>2 full crashes</li>
            <li>3 clean installs of Windows 10</li>
            <li>getting <b>BOTH</b> of my graphics cards stuck in two different motherboards</li>
            <li>Having the HDD completely give out with my OS on it</li>
    </ul>
I have finally finished getting all my parts in this new case and it actually works great.
